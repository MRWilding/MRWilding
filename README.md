ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MRWilding, I'm a data analyst who dabbles in engineering working in the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (part of the Department of Health and Social Care)

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis, modelling and engineering. I have been working on Screening data storage and reproducible analytical pipelines for the past 3 years. Up until recently all my code was stored on a private gitlab instance and will only be migrated across to here as I need to use it.

ðŸ“« My work email is michael.wilding@dhsc.gov.uk

I have 2 other github profiles:

- https://github.com/WildingM (previous PHE profile used for a specific project)
- https://github.com/wildcatmik (personal profile)
